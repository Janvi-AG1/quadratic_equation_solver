#quadratic_equation_solver 
this program can solve any quadratic equation. even those with imaginary roots

✨This qudratic equation solver user math and cmath modules.
✨every answer is rounded up using a custom round up function!
✨Writing this code gave me a solid understanding of functions and modules; how to define them, call them and use them
✨plus this code gives u the value of discriminant, nature of roots and the roots as well! COOL RIGHT!!

I think this can solve any random quadratic equation given by a cruel teacher, a competetive classmate
or found in a poorly examined textbook solution. 

thank you for reading this and veiwing my code!!
